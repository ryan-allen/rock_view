IMPORTANT

[ ] rename to Rock::View
[x] change loader to use this format CAN'T DO THIS!!! SHITE
<% assigns :one, :two, :three %>
<% template do %>
  blah blah blah
  <%= one %>
  <%= two %>
  <%= three %>
  this means we have to make loader load rhtml files only, and allow template method to set 
  template from return value of the block (which means we have to run erb on context of class
  when loading...)
<% end %>
[x] figure out an alternative to the above todo that we can't do! :(
[x] done it!!!

[x] the two below are related and fix this conflict: `const_missing': uninitialized constant Cash::Pages
[x] scoped render (i.e. render 'layout', :scope => 'flashden' will render 'flashden/layout')
[x] load path into module scope (i.e. load('some/path', :scope => FlashDen::Views))

IDEAL

[ ] automated rails inlcludes (i.e. dispatch prepare, mixin helpers, plugin)
[ ] friendly exceptions on method_missing w/ chain of responsibility trickling

QUALITY / DISTRIBUTION

[ ] redo tests in rspec (they need to be properly factored, dsl test is testing some behaviour implicitly)
[ ] refactoring makes martin fowler proud
[ ] readme for the masses
[ ] blog so...
[ ] ... blog post for the masses

MISC

[ ] every template has it's own css?
[ ] every template has its own js?
