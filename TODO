[x] loader for collis!
[ ] resolve via subclasses instead of constants?
[ ] strict assigns? (i.e. required_assigns :item, :user ...)
[ ] ability to scope resolve (i.e. scope 'flashden' do render 'layout' which loads 'flashden/layout')
[ ] better exceptions on unhandled trickle methods
[ ] readme
[ ] load into scope (i.e load path X into scope Views)
[ ] default scope (i.e. default scope 'Flashden::Views' resolve('blah') looks for Flashden::Views::Blah, so we can put all templates in say Flashden::Views...)
[ ] page, element, component!!! go collis!
[ ] does every view have it's own css? how about cview compile::css, same for js? cview::compile::js ?? ooh shit
