MISC

[ ] rails helpers (i.e. controller methods, )
[ ] ability to scope resolve (i.e. scope 'flashden' do render 'layout' which loads 'flashden/layout')
[ ] better exceptions on unhandled trickle methods
[ ] README w/ elaboration on element/layout/scope, usage patterns (composition, chain of responsibility)
[ ] load into scope (i.e load path X into scope Views)
[ ] refactor big time!!! (tests too!)
[ ] resolve via subclasses instead of constants?
[ ] default scope (i.e. default scope 'Flashden::Views' resolve('blah') looks for Flashden::Views::Blah, so we can put all templates in say Flashden::Views...)
[ ] does every view have it's own css? how about cview compile::css, same for js? cview::compile::js ?? ooh shit

BUGS

[ ] need to make :default => nil work
