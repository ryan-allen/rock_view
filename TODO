IMPORTANT

[ ] rename to Rock::View
[ ] remove dependency on active_support
[ ] allow arbitrary paths, (i.e. plurals) like 'views/article/pages/posts'
[ ] more efficient reloading of files in dev mode (see camping's reloader for ideas)
[ ] change assigns to create assign= methods, so we can alias them :)

IDEAL

[ ] automated rails includes (i.e. dispatch prepare, mixin helpers, plugin)
[ ] friendly exceptions on method_missing w/ chain of responsibility trickling

QUALITY / DISTRIBUTION

[ ] redo tests in rspec (they need to be properly factored, dsl test is testing some behaviour implicitly)
[ ] refactoring makes martin fowler proud
[ ] readme for the masses
[ ] blog so...
[ ] ... blog post for the masses

MISC

[ ] every template has it's own css?
[ ] every template has its own js?
[ ] take all these js/css and compile into one file automatically?

BUGS / UNKNOWN

[ ] fix this error:
      vendor/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:477:in `const_missing': uninitialized constant Page::Interviews
      RAILS_ROOT: script/../config/..
      Application Trace | Framework Trace | Full Trace
      vendor/cview/cview.rb:208:in `create_class'
      (eval):1:in `create_class'
      /Users/ryan/development/flashden/march11/config/environment.rb:93:in `LOAD_SITE_CONFIG'
      /Users/ryan/development/flashden/march11/config/environment.rb:120
      
[ ] the above might have something to do with how rails automagically creates
    modules/constants and whatnot i.e. View::Something::Blah will be alrighty if
    View::Something is not defined?
