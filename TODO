REFACTORING

[ ] fix up internals (w/ spec and template)
[ ] alias Rock::View & implement tests
[ ] refactor to Rock::View

Rock::View.specify 'some/path' do
  assigns :one, :two, :three
  template 'some html w/ erb in here'
end

Rock::View.construct do
  render 'layout', :heading => 'hi' do
    render 'page' :content => 'something...'
  end
end

IMPORTANT

[ ] rename to Rock::View
[x] remove dependency on active_support
[x] allow arbitrary paths, (i.e. plurals) like 'views/article/pages/posts'
[ ] more efficient reloading of files in dev mode (see camping's reloader for ideas)
[ ] change assigns to create assign= methods, so we can alias them :)

IDEAL

[ ] automated rails includes (i.e. dispatch prepare, mixin helpers, plugin)
[ ] friendly exceptions on method_missing w/ chain of responsibility trickling
[ ] i.e. make this error raise proper w/ ERB like rails does: 
    NoMethodError in New userController#profile
    undefined method `user' for #<CView::DSL:0x2e24b87c>

QUALITY / DISTRIBUTION

[ ] redo tests in rspec (they need to be properly factored, dsl test is testing some behaviour implicitly)
[ ] refactoring makes martin fowler proud
[ ] readme for the masses
[ ] blog so...
[ ] ... blog post for the masses

MISC

[ ] every template has it's own css?
[ ] every template has its own js?
[ ] take all these js/css and compile into one file automatically?

BUGS / UNKNOWN

[ ] fix this error:
      vendor/rails/activesupport/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:477:in `const_missing': uninitialized constant Page::Interviews
      RAILS_ROOT: script/../config/..
      Application Trace | Framework Trace | Full Trace
      vendor/cview/cview.rb:208:in `create_class'
      (eval):1:in `create_class'
      /Users/ryan/development/flashden/march11/config/environment.rb:93:in `LOAD_SITE_CONFIG'
      /Users/ryan/development/flashden/march11/config/environment.rb:120      
[ ] the above might have something to do with how rails automagically creates
    modules/constants and whatnot i.e. View::Something::Blah will be alrighty if
    View::Something is not defined?
[ ] oh and one remedy of the above is to change the loading scheme with a different reloader or something...
